<p align="justify">This table was created semi-automatically. In the next step, I will write a script that automatically creates the table for me. This is a good example of electronic data processing.</p>

> <p align="justify">The general idea is to go both ways. Automatically generate a table from raw data. Conversely, automatically create raw data from a table. In addition, check for duplicate entries and sort the data. </p>
