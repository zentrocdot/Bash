# Description
# The sed script reads a file line by line. If there is data after a
# semicolon ; followed by a space the data is extracted from the line
# and printed out line by line. Empty lines are ignored and if there
# is no valid data the field is ignored too.
#
# Output takes place in the correct order!
#
# The script works as expected. However, there is still potential and
# need for optimisation.
#
# Limitation:
# If the pattern is escaped like \; it will not be recognised.
#
# Example for a file content to work with:
# ; United Kingdom; Germany; Marshall Islands; France
# ; Argentina; Saint Kitts and Nevis
# ; Vanuatu
# ; United States
# ; Australia; Norway; Mexico
# ; Brazil; Cyprus

# Assign the command line argument to the global variable.
FN=$1

# Print out the extracted data line by line.
