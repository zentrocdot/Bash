### Motivation

<p align="justify">While using sed I decided to take a deeper look in the things which can be done with sed. This section is the result of my research.</p>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">I used the GNU sed tutorial to learn more about sed. In the references there are some helpful resources about sed scripts or one-liner. Some of them are more suitable for everyday use than others. Some of the one-liners are self-explanatory and commonplace. The references are initially a loose collection of sed one-liners. I have yet to make an exact evaluation. It seems that all or most of them are based on the work of Eric Pement.</p>
