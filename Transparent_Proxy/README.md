# README

<pre>Read the section 'Prerequisites' and 'Warning' first before using the transparent proxy.</pre>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">There are various ways to anonymize the Internet traffic. One way is using a tool called <code>proxychains</code> another way is using <code>Tor</code>. For <code>proxychains</code> one needs a list of proxy servers of type socks5, socks4, https and http.</p>

### Motivation

<p align="justify">I tried <code>proxychains</code> with several proxy servers in parallel to <code>Tor</code>. The use of both approaches was unsatisfactory for me. So I decided to use an different approach.</p>

### Objective

<p align="justify">The aim should be to anonymise all Internet traffic via an interface without having to worry about whether a program is running or not in the background. TCP/IP traffic as well as DNS requests should be tunneled over the approach.</p>

### Approach

<p align="justify">The chosen approach is a transparent proxy that tunnels any type of Internet traffic locally over the defined interface. It should also be possible to control the transparent proxy via a GUI. In the end, I implemented this as Bash script.</p>

### Security Check

<p align="justify">For certain groups of people, their lives may depend on Internet traffic not having leaks that jeopardize their anonymity. I wrote the script <code>anonymity_check.bash</code> to check, if everything works the right way. The results of the performed tests can be independently checked against other sources.</p>

### Customisation Trans Proxy

<p align="justify">Change the variable _OUT_IF="wlan0" to your personal needs. That's all you have to do to get the trans proxy running.</p>

### Prerequisites

<p align="justify">Installation of <code>resolvconf</code> and <code>xdotool</code> is required.</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install resolvconf
sudo apt-get install xdotool</pre>

### Warning

<p align="justify">It is recommended to make a copy of <code>resolv.conf</code>. If <code>resolvconf</code> is not installed, DNS requests will fail in the future. In the year 2018, when I wrote the transparent proxy, <code>resolvconf</code> was still installed by default.</p>

## anonymity_check.bash

<p align="justify">The script performs the following tests:</p>

1. Checks if Tor is runninng on boot
2. Checks if DNS over Tor is working
3. Checks if DNS in general is working
4. Checks if the Tor exit node is valid
5. Shows the geolocation data of the IP
