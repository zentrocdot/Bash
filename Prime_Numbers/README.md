## Motivation

<p align="justify">I have never really thought about prime numbers. This changed when I needed a script to quickly determine the aspect ratio of images. In the end, I no longer needed the prime numbers there. I then devoted myself to the subject a little more intensively.</p>

## Introduction

<p align="justify">The numbers that are not prime numbers are called composite numbers. Every set of natural numbers can be spliced in prime numbers and composite numbers.</p>

## Spin-Off

<p align="justify">A spin-off of my activities was that I was testing if I can calculate prime numbers on my graphic card. With Bash this cannot be done, but with Python this is easily realised.</p>
