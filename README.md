# Bash Programming

### Introduction
> Many years ago, I generally gave up working with Windows. Before that point, I used Windows and Linux in parallel and sometimes Unix. In the early days I used Suse Linux. Later I came to Ubuntu and finally to Mint.

### Content

> This repository is a collection of helpful bash scripts. I assume Debian, Ubuntu or Mint as the operating system.
