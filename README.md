# Bash Programming

### Background

> <p align="justify">Many years ago, I generally gave up working with Windows. Before that point, I used Windows and Linux in parallel and sometimes Unix as well as Sinix. In the first days of my Linux experience I used Suse Linux. Later on I came to Ubuntu and finally to Mint. In between I also used Raspian.</p>

> <p align="justify">I used Basic intensively on the C64 and on the Apple IIe. I always missed the good programming options that were available as standard under MS-DOS and Windows. So I used Pascal/Turbo Pascal and also Fortran. I also programmed in C/C++ from time to time.</p>

### Motivation

> <p align="justify">When I came to the Linux world scripting became in the focus of my interest. And here the tool of choice is Bash, which is always available. Whenever things need to be done, I do them in Bash or Python. Perl 5 has recently been added. In general, I try to use the right programming language for a related problem. If necessary, I also learn a new programming language.</p>

### Introduction

> <p align="justify">The last two weeks I have once again built a prototype computer for various tasks. While installing the operating system and software and looking through my old hard disks, I found a few interesting scripts. I am also posting them here now.</p>

### Content

> <p align="justify">This repository is a collection of helpful bash scripts. I assume Debian, Ubuntu or Mint as the operating system. Recurring tasks can be ideally mapped in algorithms.</p>
