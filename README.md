# Bash Programming

### Introduction

> Many years ago, I generally gave up working with Windows. Before that point, I used Windows and Linux in parallel and sometimes Unix as well as Sinix. In the first days of my Linux experience I used Suse Linux. Later on I came to Ubuntu and finally to Mint. In between I also used Raspian.

> I used Basic intensively on the C64 and on the Apple IIe. I always missed the good programming options that were available as standard under DOS and Windows. So I used Turbo Pascal and also Fortran.

> When I came to the Linux world Scripting became in the focus of my interest. And here the tool of choice is Bash, which is always available.

### Content

> This repository is a collection of helpful bash scripts. I assume Debian, Ubuntu or Mint as the operating system.
