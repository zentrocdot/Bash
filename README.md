# Bash Programming

### Background

<p align="justify">Many years ago, I generally gave up working with <code>MS-Windows</code>. Before that point, I used <code>MS-Windows</code> and <code>Linux</code> in parallel and sometimes <code>Unix</code> as well as <code>Sinix</code>. In the first years of my <code>Linux</code> experience I used <code>Suse Linux</code>. Later on I came to <code>Ubuntu</code> and finally to <code>Mint</code>. In between and also current I am also using <code>Raspian</code>.</p>

<p align="justify">I used <code>Basic</code> intensively on both the <code>C64</code> and the <code>Apple IIe</code>. I really missed these good programming options, which were available as standard on both the <code>C64</code> and the <code>Apple IIe</code> under <code>MS-DOS</code> and <code>MS-Windows</code>. Batch programming was only a mediocre substitute as a programming tool for carrying out various tasks. So I used <code>Pascal/Turbo Pascal</code> and also <code>Fortran</code>, among others. From time to time I also programmed in <code>C/C++</code>.</p>

<p align="justify">Long long ago at school we had a <code>teletype writer (tty)</code> in addition to the <code>Apple IIe</code> in our computer science lessons.</p>

### Motivation

<p align="justify">When I came to the <code>Linux world</code> scripting became in the focus of my interest. And here the tool of choice is <code>Bash</code>, which is always available. Whenever things need to be done, I do them in <code>Bash</code> or <code>Python</code>. <code>Perl 5</code> has recently been added to the later two programming languages. In general, I try to use the right programming language for a related problem. If necessary, I also learn a new programming language.</p>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">The last few weeks I have once again built a prototype computer for various tasks. While installing the operating system and software and looking through my old hard disks, I found a few interesting scripts. I am also posting them here now. I am also forced to reconsider what I had programmed and whether it corresponds to the current state of knowledge.</p>

### Content

<p align="justify">This repository is a collection of helpful <code>Bash scripts</code>. I assume <code>Debian</code>, <code>Ubuntu</code> or <code>Mint</code> as the operating system. Recurring tasks can be ideally mapped in algorithms.</p>

### Remark

<p align="justify">So far almost all of the listed scripts are working under <code>Linux Mint 21.3</code>code> without problems. In very rare cases I have to install a missing package.</p>

### Naming

<p align="justify">The names of the scripts were assigned according to the task to be performed. I have not checked whether there are <code>Bash scripts</code> worldwide that use the same or similar names. This would be a pure coincidence.</p>

<p align="justify">The file extensions of the <code>Bash scripts</code> are in general <code>.bash</code>.</p>

### To-Do

<p align="justify">Some scripts still need to be revised with regard to comments and documentation. This will be done step by step.</p>

### Web Links

<p align="justify">I do not use web links to prevent unnecessary Internet traffic. Web links are references.</p>
