# Bash Programming

### Background

<p align="justify">Many years ago, I generally gave up working with Windows. Before that point, I used Windows and Linux in parallel and sometimes Unix as well as Sinix. In the first days of my Linux experience I used Suse Linux. Later on I came to Ubuntu and finally to Mint. In between I also used Raspian.</p>

<p align="justify">I used Basic intensively on both the C64 and the Apple IIe. I really missed these good programming options, which were available as standard on both the C64 and the Apple IIe, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows. Batch programming was only a mediocre substitute as a programming tool for carrying out various tasks. So I used Pascal/Turbo Pascal and also Fortran, among others. From time to time I also programmed in C/C++.</p>

### Motivation

<p align="justify">When I came to the Linux world scripting became in the focus of my interest. And here the tool of choice is Bash, which is always available. Whenever things need to be done, I do them in Bash or Python. Perl 5 has recently been added. In general, I try to use the right programming language for a related problem. If necessary, I also learn a new programming language.</p>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">The last two weeks I have once again built a prototype computer for various tasks. While installing the operating system and software and looking through my old hard disks, I found a few interesting scripts. I am also posting them here now.</p>

### Content

<p align="justify">This repository is a collection of helpful bash scripts. I assume Debian, Ubuntu or Mint as the operating system. Recurring tasks can be ideally mapped in algorithms.</p>

### Remark

<p align="justify">So far almost all of the listed scripts are working under Linux Mint 21.3 without problems. In very rare cases I have to install a missing package.</p>

### Naming

<p align="justify">The names of the scripts were assigned according to the task to be performed. I have not checked whether there are Bash scripts worldwide that use the same or similar names. This would be a pure coincidence.</p>

### To-Do

<p align="justify">Some scripts still need to be revised with regard to comments and documentation. This will be done step by step.</p>
