# Description:
# The prime numbers are calculated using a algorithm based on the Sieve of
# Eratosthenes.
#
# The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple systematic procedure for finding prime
# numbers. First all of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) up to a given value
# are arranged in numerical order. The number 1 is striked out, because 1 is
# not a prime number. Then every second number following on number 2 is striked
# out, then every third number following the number 3 is striked out and so on.
# This is continued in the same manner for all of the other numbers. Every nth
# number following the number n is striked out. The remaining numbers are the
# prime number.
#
# The intention to write this script is to save primes using the sieve in one
# array and the composite numbers in another array. The length von both array
# must result in the number which is given.
#
# To-Do:
# Check if the algorithm is working as expected under all possible conditions.
