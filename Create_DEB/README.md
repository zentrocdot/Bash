While working on the desription for creating a DEB Package for LibreOffice I remembered myself, 
that I wrote long ago a script for creating DEB packages for Bash scripts. I added here an example
for the moment based on my tool wapscan.

A review of the script which is creating the DEBIAN skeleton for packaging DEB files and the DEB package
itself will follow shortly.
