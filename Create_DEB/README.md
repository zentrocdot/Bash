While working on the desription for creating a DEB Package for LibreOffice I remembered myself, 
that I wrote long ago a script for creating DEB packages for Bash scripts. I added here an example
for the moment based on my tool wapscan.

A review of the script which is creating the DEBIAN skeleton for packaging DEB files and the DEB package
itself will follow shortly.

I was able after now six years to use my created DEB package to integrate my Wireless Access Point scan tool
to my new Linux Mint without further changes. That's quite nice.
