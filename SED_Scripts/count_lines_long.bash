# Count lines in a file

# Description:
# The sed script counts the lines in a file. If there is a line in the
# file, the number of lines is output, otherwise the output is empty.
#
# If no file name is given on the command line the output is always
# empty. Otherwise, what was written previously is valid.
#
# Use at the command line:
#     man sed
#     info sed
#
# Motivation.
# This sed script is another good example to take a deeper look in the
# possibilities of sed. The script demonstrates how to work with pattern
# space and hold space.
