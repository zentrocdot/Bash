# Description
# The sed script reads a file line by line. If there is data after a
# semicolon ; the data is extracted from the line and printed out line
# by line. Empty lines are ignored and if there is no valid data the
# field is ignored too.
#
# Output takes place in the correct order!
#
# The script works as expected. However, there is still potential and
# need for optimisation.
#
# Limitation:
# If the pattern is escaped like e.g. '\;' it will not be recognised.
#
# Example for a file content to work with:
#   ; United Kingdom; Germany; Marshall Islands; France
#   ; Argentina; Saint Kitts and Nevis
#   ; Vanuatu
#   ; United States
#   ; Australia; Norway; Mexico
#   ; Brazil; Cyprus
# Resulting output:
#   ;  United Kingdom
#   ;  Germany
#   ;  Marshall Islands
#   ;  France
#   ;  Argentina
#   ;  Saint Kitts and Nevis
#   ;  Vanuatu
#   ;  United States
#   ;  Australia
#   ;  Norway
#   ;  Mexico
#   ;  Brazil
#   ;  Cyprus

# Assign the command line argument to the global variable.

# Set pattern. Default value is ;.
