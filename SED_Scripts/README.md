### Motivation

<p align="justify">While using sed I decided to take a deeper look in the things which can be done with sed. This section is the result of my research.</p>

### Introduction

<p align="justify">I used the GNU sed tutorial to learn more about sed. In the references there are some helpful resources about sed scripts or one-liner. Some of them are more suitable for everyday use than others. Some of the one-liners are self-explanatory and commonplace. The references are initially a loose collection of sed one-liners. I have yet to make an exact evaluation. It seems that all or most of them are based on the work of Eric Pement.</p> 

### Introductory Words

<p align="justify">One disadvantage of sed is that it is not possible to hand over command line argument to the script. In awk this is not a problem at all. Nevertheless working with sed in Bash allows to use command line arguments. But one has to take care about single and double quotes.</p> 

### To-Do

<p align="justify">Up to now I used the Bash script as container for the sed script. When I have spare time I will take a look if there are an advantage to run sed as stand alone script.</p>
