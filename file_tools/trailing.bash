#
# Description:
# Remove leading and trailing spaces from a file. Read the file and exchange
# line feed, carriage return and tab by one space.
#
# Background Information:
# If one tries to replace linefeeds together with the substitution this will
# fail. Reading line by line sed will not see the trailing line feeds. So we
# have to carry out various operations one after the other.
#
# Explanation:
#
# s/^[[:space:]]*//g -> remove leading spaces
# s/[[:space:]]*$//g -> remove trailing spaces
#
# :a;N;$!ba
#
# :a   -> create a label 'a'
# N    -> append the next line to the pattern space
# $!ba -> if it is not the last line, branch to (go to) label 'a'
#
# sed will loop through these three steps until the last line is reached,
# grabbing all lines fit in the pattern space where sed will perform the
# substitutions.
#
# s/[\n\r]/ /g -> substitute line feed and carriage return by one space
# s/\t]/ /g    -> substitute tab by one space
#
# Global match means as many times as it is possible.
