# Remove Comments

# You are using the script on your own risk. If you have any doubts whether
# the script is working correctly, you should always make a backup copy of
# the file to be on the secure side.
#
# Description:
# The script removes all single-line and inline comments from a file that
# start with a hashtag #. Inline comments must be preceded by one or more
# spaces before the hashtag # for the inline comment to be valid as such.
# Regular comments are recognised with or without indentation.
#
# Explanation:
# First line is checked on the existence of a Shebang which is always
# introduced by '#!/' followed by different possible paths. If there is
# a Shebang, such a line is not a comment line. Regular comments are
# identified with or without indentation and than deleted. Inline comments
# starts with one or more space followed by a hashtag # with characters up
# to the end of the line and removed.
#
# Functionality Check:
# This script is used for the functionality check, based on the fact that in
# the sed command there is the hashtag three times and this are not comments.
#
# Possible usage of the hashtag # in Bash:
#   # Comment lines
#   echo "#"
#   printf "#"
#   var="#"
#   var='#'
#   array=('#')
#   dict=(["#"]="comment")
#   dict['#']='comment'
#   ${#len_of_str}
#   ${myvar#pattern}
#   ${myvar##pattern}
#   to be completed ...
#
# Limitation:
# If opening and closing expressions [{(<"'...'">)}] exists after a hashtag #,
# this comment will not be touched.
#
# To-Do:
# Check pattern matching of the inline comments and improve the recognition
# if necessary.
