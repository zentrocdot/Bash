## GIMP and G'MIC

<p align="justify">I have been using GIMP and the G'MIC plugin for years now successfully. GIMP itself is a really good tool and the plugin G'MIC produces impressive results.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the years the installation procedure changes a little bit. In addition to the installation via the system using <code>apt-get install gimp</code> GIMP can be installed by use of flatpak. This is the recommended way. Another way is to build GIMP from source.</p>

<p align="justify">This morning I wrote a simple script <code>install_gimp.bash</code>code>. This script allows me to install GIMP and G'MIC in an automatic way. Today I had also to learn a few things that I incorporated into the script.</p>
